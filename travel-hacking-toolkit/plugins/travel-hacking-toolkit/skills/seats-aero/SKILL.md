# Seats.aero Skill

Search cached and live award flight availability across 27 mileage programs (including Spirit Free Spirit and Frontier Miles, added April 2026). Find the cheapest award flights, compare programs, and get booking links.

**Source:** [seats.aero](https://seats.aero) | [API Docs](https://developers.seats.aero) | [Knowledge Base](https://docs.seats.aero)

## Authentication

Set `SEATS_AERO_API_KEY` in your `.env` file. Get from [Settings > API tab](https://seats.aero/settings) (Pro account required).

All requests use the `Partner-Authorization` header. Pro users get **1,000 API calls per day** for non-commercial use.

## Key Concepts

### Saver vs Dynamic Pricing

Award seats fall into two categories:

- **Saver (fixed price):** Set, predictable miles cost. Often the ONLY type bookable through partner programs. Best value. Always shown on Seats.aero.
- **Dynamic:** Price changes based on demand (like cash fares). Can be reasonable or extremely expensive. Seats.aero **filters out overpriced dynamic awards by default.**

### Dynamic Price Filter Thresholds

Awards exceeding these per-hour thresholds are hidden automatically:

| Program | Economy | Prem Econ | Business | First |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------|-------|
| American | <100K total | <100K total | <150K total | <200K total |
| United | 7,500/hr | 10,000/hr | 14,000/hr | 20,000/hr (max 10h) |
| Delta | 10,000/hr | 15,000/hr | 20,000/hr | N/A |
| Aeroplan | 7,500/hr | 10,000/hr | 12,500/hr | 15,000/hr |
| Flying Blue | 5,000/hr | 10,000/hr | 15,000/hr | 15,000/hr |
| Alaska | <150K total | <150K total | <150K total | <150K total |
| Aeromexico | 10,000/hr (max 10h) | 15,000/hr | 20,000/hr | N/A |
| Etihad | 10,000/hr (max 10h) | 15,000/hr | 20,000/hr | N/A |
| JetBlue | 10,000/hr | 15,000/hr | 20,000/hr | N/A |
| Qantas | 7,500/hr | 10,000/hr | 20,000/hr | 25,000/hr |

To see ALL dynamic pricing (including expensive): pass `include_filtered=true` on cached search/bulk, or `disable_filters=true` / `show_dynamic_pricing=true` on live search.

### Phantom Availability

Sometimes a flight shows bookable but no seat actually exists. Causes:
- **Cached/stale results:** Check `ComputedLastSeen` for freshness.
- **Syncing delays:** Seats taken but partner systems haven't updated.
- **Partner feed glitches:** Programs incorrectly show space on partners.

**Always verify on the airline's own site before transferring points.** Compare multiple programs in the same alliance. Call to confirm and hold if possible.

### Foreign Program Caveats

Some programs (Smiles, TudoAzul, etc.) may require local tax IDs, local payment methods, or are only available in the local language. They still appear in results because they can serve as **signals**: if Azul TudoAzul shows United saver space, that same space is likely bookable through Aeroplan or other Star Alliance partners you CAN access.

### Award Release Dates

Airlines release award seats at different advance windows (e.g., Aeroplan releases up to 358 days out). Check [seats.aero/tools/releases](https://seats.aero/tools/releases) to see the maximum days out for each airline by program. Useful for planning when to start searching.

### Availability Objects

Each result from Cached Search / Bulk Availability is a **summary** that groups all flights for one route/date/program into a single object. For example, if Alaska shows 3 different SFO>LAX flights on Mar 16, they all appear in one availability object. The `MileageCost` fields show the **cheapest** option. The `RemainingSeats` fields show the **maximum** across all flights. Use Get Trips to see individual flight details.

Real-time search for ANY city pair (not limited to monitored routes). **Commercial agreement required.** Not available to Pro users via API.

5-15 second response times. Build proper error handling with exponential backoff.

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Partner-Authorization: $SEATS_AERO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"origin_airport":"SFO","destination_airport":"NRT","departure_date":"2026-08-15","source":"united","seat_count":2}' \
  "https://seats.aero/partnerapi/live" | jq '.'
```

### Parameters (JSON body)

| `show_dynamic_pricing` | No | Disable only dynamic pricing filter, keep airport filtering |

**Important:** IDs returned from live search are NOT real and cannot be used with other Seats.aero APIs (Get Trips, etc.). Live results are ephemeral.

## Pagination

All list endpoints use `skip` + `cursor`. On first call, omit both. From the response, save the `cursor` value. On subsequent calls, pass `cursor` and increment `skip` by the number of results received.

The `cursor` is a Unix timestamp. Treat it as opaque. Rare duplicates are possible across pages. Deduplicate by `ID`.

## Useful jq Filters

```bash
# Business class availability sorted by cheapest miles
... | jq '[.data[] | select(.JAvailable == true) | {date: .Date, origin: .Route.OriginAirport, dest: .Route.DestinationAirport, miles: (.JMileageCost | tonumber), seats: .JRemainingSeats, airlines: .JAirlines, source: .Source, direct: .JDirect}] | sort_by(.miles)'

# Saver vs dynamic detection: if miles < threshold, likely saver
# AA: J saver ~57.5K for transatlantic, dynamic 100K+
# United: J saver ~60-80K for transatlantic, dynamic 100K+
... | jq '[.data[] | select(.JAvailable == true) | {date: .Date, miles: (.JMileageCost | tonumber), source: .Source, type: (if (.JMileageCost | tonumber) < 80000 then "likely_saver" else "dynamic" end)}]'

# Economy availability with 2+ seats
... | jq '[.data[] | select(.YAvailable == true and .YRemainingSeats >= 2) | {date: .Date, origin: .Route.OriginAirport, dest: .Route.DestinationAirport, miles: (.YMileageCost | tonumber), seats: .YRemainingSeats, source: .Source}] | sort_by(.miles)'

# All available cabins for a date range
... | jq '[.data[] | {date: .Date, origin: .Route.OriginAirport, dest: .Route.DestinationAirport, source: .Source, economy: (if .YAvailable then .YMileageCost else null end), business: (if .JAvailable then .JMileageCost else null end), first: (if .FAvailable then .FMileageCost else null end)}]'

# Direct flights only in business
... | jq '[.data[] | select(.JAvailable == true and .JDirect == true) | {date: .Date, miles: .JMileageCost, airlines: .JAirlines, source: .Source}]'

# Check data freshness (stale = potential phantom)
... | jq '[.data[] | {date: .Date, source: .Source, last_seen: .ComputedLastSeen}]'
```

## Workflow: Trip Planning Search

1. **Cached Search** across multiple airports and date ranges to see what's available
2. **Compare programs**: check which `source` has the cheapest miles for the same route
3. **Identify saver vs dynamic**: low prices (e.g., 57.5K J for AA transatlantic) = saver. High prices (100K+) = dynamic.
4. **Get Trip Details** on promising availability IDs for flight times, connections, and booking links
5. **Verify freshness**: check `ComputedLastSeen`. If stale (hours old), the availability may be phantom.
6. **Cross-reference**: check the airline's own site or call to confirm before transferring points
7. **Use booking_links** from trip response to book directly on each program's site
8. Cross-reference with AwardWallet balances to confirm enough points

## Why Results May Be Empty

1. **No saver space released.** Most programs only show saver awards to partners. Check the airline's own site.
2. **Elite/status restrictions.** Some seats only visible to elite members or cardholders.
3. **Route not monitored.** If the route isn't in Get Routes, cached search won't have it. Live search can check any route.
4. **Search window limits.** Airlines release awards at different advance windows. Check [release dates tool](https://seats.aero/tools/releases).
5. **Already booked.** Award space changes constantly. Set alerts for notification when it opens.

## Specialized Tools (Web UI Only)

These tools are available on the seats.aero website but not via the Partner API:

- **Alaska Upgrade Finder** ([seats.aero/alaska/upgrades](https://seats.aero/alaska/upgrades)): Find confirmable upgrade space for Alaska elites using Atmos Gold Guest Upgrade certificates. Dedicated tool for scanning upgrade availability.
- **Etihad First Class Finder** ([seats.aero/etihad/first](https://seats.aero/etihad/first)): Dedicated tracker for newly available Etihad First Class seats. Etihad F is rare and highly sought after. This tool surfaces new availability faster than general search.
- **Price History**: Fare trends over time are available on the web UI but not via API. Use the `seats-aero-web` skill (Patchright browser automation) to access price history charts.

## Alert Features

When creating alerts on seats.aero:

- **Time filters**: Departure and arrival time ranges are available as alert filters. Useful for avoiding red-eyes or ensuring morning arrivals.
- **Cabin, route, and program filters**: Standard alert parameters.
- Alerts notify via email or push when matching availability appears.

## Third-Party Integrations

Pro account holders can connect seats.aero to third-party apps via the "Connect seats.aero" button on the website.

- **aeroconnections.app** (by @wavydavy): Visualization tool that shows available connections from specific airports. Log in with your Pro account to see current award space mapped visually. Useful for exploring routing options you wouldn't think to search.

## Notes

- All times in responses are local airport times.
- `TotalTaxes` is in cents (divide by 100 for dollars).
- `MileageCost` in availability objects is a string. In trip objects it's an integer.
- `AllianceCost` in trip objects shows what booking through an alliance partner would cost.
- Dynamic pricing filters are on by default. Pass `include_filtered=true` to see everything.
- Availability data is cached, not live. Check `ComputedLastSeen` for freshness.
- Pro users: 1,000 API calls/day. Failed live searches don't count.
- Free users can only search 30 days ahead. Pro unlocks 60+ days.
- Post-search filters (max points, stops, duration, etc.) now apply directly to flight detail results, not just the search results list.
