# TripAdvisor Content API

Search and retrieve hotel, restaurant, and attraction data from TripAdvisor. Ratings, rankings, reviews, photos, amenities, subratings, trip types, awards.

**Base URL:** `https://api.content.tripadvisor.com/api/v1`

**Rate limit:** 50 calls per second.

**Monthly quota:** 5,000 API calls per month. Each curl request = 1 call. A full hotel lookup (search + details + reviews + photos) = 4 calls. Budget accordingly. Prefer search + details (2 calls) and only fetch reviews/photos when specifically needed.

**API limits:** Up to 10 results per search. Up to 5 reviews and 5 photos per location.

## Authentication

> **First-time setup gotcha:** TripAdvisor requires whitelisting your outbound IP at https://www.tripadvisor.com/developers before the key works. Without this, every call returns `User is not authorized to access this resource with an explicit deny`. This is the #1 first-time failure mode. **Whitelist before troubleshooting auth or quotas.**
>
> - **How to find your current IP:** `curl ifconfig.me`
> - **Propagation:** changes take 1-5 minutes (AWS edge cache).
> - **Multi-IP:** residential CGNAT, VPN exits, and different networks each need their own entry.
> - **No Referer alternative:** the free tier requires IP whitelisting; HTTP Referer restriction is not available.
> - **Verify which key is which:** the developer portal shows the last 4 chars only (e.g. "Ends in 11D7"), so you can confirm without exposing the secret.

Set `TRIPADVISOR_API_KEY` in your `.env` file:

```bash
# In .env (gitignored)
TRIPADVISOR_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Then source it before calling:

```bash
export $(grep TRIPADVISOR_API_KEY .env | xargs)
```

### Error signatures

| Response | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `User is not authorized to access this resource with an explicit deny` | IP not on allowlist | Whitelist current IP at the developer portal, wait 1-5 min |
| `Forbidden` / 403 with no body | Bad or expired key | Regenerate key |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Hit monthly quota (5,000 calls) | Wait until next month or upgrade tier |

## When to Use

- Evaluating hotels (ratings, rankings, subratings, review sentiment)
- Comparing restaurants near a hotel or in a neighborhood
- Finding attractions and things to do near a destination
- Getting TripAdvisor ranking data ("#1 of 168 hotels in Stockholm")
- Checking amenities, trip type breakdown, award status
- Verifying hotel chain affiliation and neighborhood info

## When NOT to Use

- **Pricing or availability.** TripAdvisor Content API has no pricing data. Use `serpapi`, `liteapi`, `chase-travel`, `amex-travel`, or `rapidapi` for prices.
- **Booking.** This is read-only data. No booking capability.
- **Bulk scraping.** 5,000 calls/month. Be deliberate.
